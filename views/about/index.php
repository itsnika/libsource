	Libsource is an educational web product, developed by Gerald Nika&#8482;.
	One of the major factors influencing the traffic in everyday operations is that of the creation of queues. In any service organization or institution, managers are mostly concerned about the time that customers are required to wait for receiving their service. In our case we have covered and treated the phenomena of queues in libraries. We treat our concern in two main significant factors which imply traffic and decrease customer satisfaction rate, which are the queue length and waiting time.  Therefore, library managers are concerned about providing the optimal service configuration that can satisfy both customers and service providers. Libsource is about providing a user-friendly, fair and efficient physical and online library service. Physical clients are offered basic operations of a library system. Clients are offered operations which can be handled online without being present. Every client will have the possibility to have an account if he wants to, or he can just explore the content without having the need of an account.
	One of the major factors influencing the success of organizations or institutions in today’s competitive world is to increase customer satisfaction through the improvement of service quality. Therefore, service organizations have focused on various ways to understand customer perceptions and have planned different strategies in order to provide a greater degree of service to customers. In any service organization, managers are mostly concerned about the time that customers are required to wait for receiving their service. The delays in receiving service which will lead to queuing are the usual problems in industrial environments and even in everyday life situations.
	Our purpose is to give as user-friendly experience as possible, so that the user will feel comfortable by using this system online and doesn’t have to stress up by waiting in long queues to complete the library operations.
